package structs

/*
	Structs in GoLang are custom data types that allow you to group/combine items of possibly different types into a single type.
	It is a way of creating more complex data types that are combinations of other data types.
 	You can compare structs in Go with the concept of classes in object-oriented programming languages,
 	although there are key differences since Go is not purely an object-oriented language.
