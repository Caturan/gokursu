package arrays

/*
& An array is a numbered sequence of elements of a specific length.
& The size of an array is part of its type. This means that [3]int and [4]int are distinct types.
& Arrays are value types, which means that when you assign one array to another, a copy of the original array is created.
 So, if you make changes to the copied array, it doesn't affect the original array.
& You must define the size of an array at the time of declaration.
& It's not possible to grow or shrink an array because its length is fixed.
