/*
First-Class Functions: In Go, functions are first-class citizens, which means you can assign them to variables,
 pass them as parameters to other functions, and return them as values from other functions.

Multiple Return Values: Unlike many other languages, Go functions can return multiple values.
 This feature is often used to return both a result and an error value from a function.

Named Return Values: Go supports named return values. You can specify a name for a return value
 and it will be treated as a variable defined at the top of the function.

Variadic Functions: Go supports variadic functions, which can be called with any number of trailing arguments.
 This is useful for functions that need to process an arbitrary number of parameters of the same type.

Anonymous Functions and Closures: Go supports anonymous functions, which can form closures.
 Anonymous functions are useful when you want to define a function inline without having to name it.

Deferred Execution: The defer keyword can be used to schedule a function call to be run after the function completes.
 It's typically used for cleanup tasks like closing a file.

Error Handling: In Go, functions typically return an error value as their last return value.
 If a function can fail, it returns an error value that describes the problem.
