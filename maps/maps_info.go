package maps

/*
Map in Golang is a built-in type that associates values of one type (the value type) with keys of another type (the key type).
 This is similar to an array, but instead of using indexing to access and modify data, you can use unique keys.

A map can be declared using the map keyword followed by the key type and the value type.

To remove a key-value pair from the map, use the built-in delete function.
