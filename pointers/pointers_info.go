package pointers

/*
	In Go, a pointer is a type that holds the memory address of a value.
	 Pointers are used to directly access and modify the memory location of a value,
	 which is particularly useful when you want to modify the value in a different scope (such as within a function)
	 or when dealing with large data where copying the value would be expensive in terms of memory and performance.

	The type *T is a pointer to a T value.

	The & operator generates a pointer to its operand

	Remember, using pointers can potentially lead to errors if not used carefully,
	 such as null pointer dereferencing or data races, so it's important to use them thoughtfully.
